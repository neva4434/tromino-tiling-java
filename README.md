# L-TROMINO TILING ALGORITHM (JAVA)

A Divide & Conquer based solution for the classic L-Tromino tiling problem
implemented using Object-Oriented Programming in Java.

---

## 📌 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Given a board of size **2ⁿ × 2ⁿ** with one damaged square,
the objective is to completely cover the board using only
L-shaped tromino tiles.

Each tromino covers exactly 3 cells.

---

## 🧠 ALGORITHM LOGIC

The algorithm works recursively:

- The board is divided into four equal quadrants.
- The quadrant containing the damaged cell is detected.
- One tromino is placed at the center.
- The process repeats for each sub-board.
